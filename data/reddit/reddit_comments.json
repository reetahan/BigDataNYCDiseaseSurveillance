Years ago, I decided that I like the idea of having primary care as part of a large hospital system, reasoning that there would be a NYU specialist for whatever specific health problems I might manifest as I age. Which has worked out pretty well thus far.\n\nIf I recall, all those years ago, I just called the general number and basically said I was looking for a PCP and who was seeing new patients and when they had availability. I connected with [Dr. Joseph Vetrano](https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1497796056/joseph-a-vetrano) as my NYU PCP, and I'm generally pleased with his skill, personality, and temperament. I may have just gotten lucky, but I bet that even if you just did what I did and just call, you'd be on a path toward finding a good PCP within the NYU system.",

They have  an app. The way I do it is find one that takes the least amount of work for me. i.e. location near where I live or work. If that doctor fits you then great. If not, find a different oe for the follow up.\n\nIn general at any of the big hospitals you should assume doctors are extremely busy. They see a lot of patients and especially for basic checkups a lot of things doesn't really need a doctor and instead RN or similar can do the duties. But what I like about NYU is that they have a large network and its easy to get an army of specialist for various needs. i.e. say your 40s and high blood pressure/heart disease runs in your family,  NYU will easily get you appointment with their cardiologist and they will do follow ups if needed  etc. If you need optomerist they have that. Sleep apnea, yes they have sleep doctors to. Gastrointestinal specialist, diabetes, physical therapist,  neurology, endocrinology? They have that. Its not one doctor. They have entire departments of doctors in each specialty.\n\nWhile you can book these appointments yourself, the pcp at NYU will get you referrals so your more easily booked. So you can build out a team of doctors for your various needs. The other thing is because its a hospital with a medical school and one of the most competitive residency programs in the country, their doctors are generally  are academically oriented than some random private  practice doctor and are up to breast with latest developments in their field.",

It will get better and you eventually won't notice it. \n\nOne thing people don't realize is that simply heating air makes it much drier. For instance, if you have air at 35 degrees at 50% humidity, that is cold air but comfortably humid (i.e. won't dry you out). A cubic meter of air at 35 degrees f can hold, at max, about 5 ml of water vapor.\n\nBut if you heat that same air to 75 degrees F, it now can hold a max of about 22 ml of water vapor, so the relative humidity, without removing any moisture, now becomes 12%. This is very dry air that will dry your skin out and the tissues in your nose and sinuses, particularly as they naturally dry out when you sleep, making them much more susceptible to getting infected\n\nThe only thing to add is that if you're seeing white or brown stuff in your humidifier as you clean it that's probably limescale or iron deposits and not mold.\n\nIt's kind of wasteful, but in a desperate pinch I will run the shower on max hot for a couple minutes to get some rapid steam into the place. If you do that and let it fill the tub the standing hot water will help a little with the humidity.\n\nBut you'll feel a lot better regardless in a week or two!",

In October when the heat kicked in, we'd have the AC running to counter it.

That happens in PE-owned practices, yes, but also in hospital-owned groups, big multi-site practices, and even some “nonprofit” systems.\n\t\nPrivate equity often accelerates this, which is why it’s more noticeable there, but the underlying pressure (squeezed reimbursement, huge billing/admin burden, and “do more with fewer people”) is sadly system-wide. \n\nSo, even if there were a perfect “no PE” map, it wouldn’t automatically guarantee a human front desk and a sane phone experience. And yes, this is an utterly craptacular system and we deserve better. \n\nAnyway, if your goal is to find a more human practice, it might be more effective to ask specific questions when you’re vetting a new office than to filter by ownership alone, like:\n\n\t•\t“Are you independently/physician owned, or part of a larger system?”\n\n\t•\t“Do calls go to a central call center, or directly to the office?”\n\n\t•\t“How do I reach a real person during business hours?”\n\nI’m not aware of any centralized reporting systems that can automatically filter this for prospective patients, and since I don’t see how that could realistically be monetized I don’t expect that to manifest anytime soon, either. In the meantime, we must be our own advocates and patient care coordinators. \n\nI’m sorry you’re still stuck navigating this, OP.

It needs to be 68F/62F everywhere in the apartment, not just where the heater is located.\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/AcuRite-00325-Comfort-Monitor-Black/dp/B004K8RF10\n\nI've got a ThermoPro in each room. \n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/ThermoPro-TP50-Digital-Thermometer-Temperature/dp/B01H1R0K68",

It's a common post-covid outcome that deserves a lot more visibility. But it can kind of sneak up on you, and by the time you realize something's wrong, it can be too late to prevent serious progression. \n\n[this article explains it in a way that is easy to understand](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/01/09/1223077307/long-covid-exercise-post-exertional-malaise-mitochondria). If any of this tracks, schedule an appt at the Mt Sinai or NYU long covid clinics. PEM is a nightmare. \n\nI hope it's a simple bug and that you are on the path to recovery, but if you've had multiple covid infections, be aware that this can be a fairly common outcome.",

Like in Astoria, Ridgewood, Sunnyside, Flushing, etc., you’ll find plenty, you just need to find a good cafe and you can tell by the quality of their brew. Some places also offer La Colombe cold brew on tap. Delis and some local coffee spots really don’t know/care for the difference and do the whole “brew hot and put it into the fridge thing” instead of let it percolate in the fridge. Probably easier in Brooklyn just because they’ve had that wave of coffee spots for longer",

Are you looking to do \"classic\" or typical NYC tourist spots, or coming to experience the city in itself?\n\nI know CFS doesn't manifest the same way for everyone, but I personally find being around tourists is exhausting and draining for me, just because they generally have such bad spacial awareness and make getting through the areas more difficult. So I go out of my way to avoid streets they are commonly on. \n\nThat being said, the best thing about NYC imo is how easy it is to get somewhere.\n\nAs for what is most taxing on my energy, it goes in this order: Subway, bus, LIRR.\n\nMainly subway sucks a lot of energy out of me because of the lack of cool air in a lot of stations and thus it traps smells/chemicals in more than being outside waiting for a bus or the LIRR.\n\nChill \"classic tourist\" spots lean more towards parks like Washington Square, Byrant Park, and Union Square.\n\nThe mall at the WTC (the Oculus) is pretty laid back too. The sculpture area of the animals outside can get pretty bonkers, but once you get in the mall, it's rather peaceful.\n\nAlso thanks to congestion pricing, it's not so bad walking around East Village/Astor Pl. A lot of cool little shops and street art to be explored between there and Greenwich if you can do the walk (since you stated you're trying to avoid a lot of walking).\n\nMight want to try and avoid the blocks around NYU in Greenwich though (like Waverly) as that can get busy with students sometimes, but still it is nothing compared to the sea of people in Times Square.\n\nWear visible-subtle headphones but don't actually listen to anything to keep your awareness up. If people see headphones, you're more likely to be left alone.",

There were 4,057 trucks per day on the bridges last year, compared to 4,013 this year. There was also no traffic increase during the same period on the Triborough Bridge, with traffic daily truck traffic actually dropping from 2,045 per day in 2024 to 1,973 per day in 2025.\n\n>On the Verrazzano Bridge, there was an increase from 2,596 trucks in 2024 to 2,644 trucks per day on weekdays, which Schwartz said was a negligible increase and in line with the nationwide trends of increased vehicle miles traveled since the end of pandemic shutdowns. The Verrazzano even saw a 5 percent drop in weekend truck traffic, Schwartz said.\n\n>At the same time, the Queens-Midtown and Brooklyn Battery tunnels saw significant drops in truck traffic, with daily weekday truck counts falling 14 percent from 904 to 781. Weekend truck traffic dropped 11 percent from 324 trucks per day to 281.\n\nRead more here: [https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/03/19/gridlock-sam-trucks-arent-rerouting-into-the-bronx-or-staten-island-to-avoid-congestion-pricing](https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2025/03/19/gridlock-sam-trucks-arent-rerouting-into-the-bronx-or-staten-island-to-avoid-congestion-pricing)",
